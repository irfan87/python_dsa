# Data Structured and Algorithms

Current technology is moving very fast. Me myself, always put `10 seconds` rule because I believe there're will be new technology, including stack, frameworks, programming language will be born and used. So, as a programmer, either a newbie or season programmer, data structured and algorithms is the basic foundation that we must have. Even the complex application, such as Google Map, used data structure and algorithms to get the exact location, based on user's lattitude and longitude. With the current resource that I have - at this momment `Grokking Algorithms`, would help me to solve the problems.

There're a lot of concepts and technique in data sturcture and algorithms that we can used, such as Big Notation, Trees, Dijkstra algorithms, Stack and so on. And I believe there might be a few (or more) of data structure and algorithms concepts that we don't know that need to explore and use. 

The reason why I choosed Python is it have it's own beauty. And I like their idioms and one of it is `simple is better than complex`. This means, a code don't need to be complex just to solve the 'Hello World' problem. Try to make it more simple and readable and make it `DRY`. Not only professional developers able to read and understand the code, but also the new-comer developers can understand how the code works.

## The Goal

The goal that I want to achieve is to explore the new world which is Deep Learning. And I would like to say thank you very much to `Grokking Algoritms` - Aditya Bhargava because have included one of the basic Machine Learning Algorithms in his book. Before this, I have no idea what is the relationship between Machine Learning and Data Structure and Algorithms but now, I found both have a strong relationship. Machine Learning majorly involve with the numbers, graphs and so on but to get the logic and solve the problems, there's come `K-Nearest Neighbour`.
